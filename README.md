tempmonitor
===========

Project to monitor the absolute temperature on two LMT86 temperature sensors
and when the difference between the two sensors is greater than a set value
turn the output on until the temperature between the sensors is below another
set value.

This is a Code Composer Studio project for the MSP430G2553. See `main.c` for
an ASCII diagram of the hardware.
